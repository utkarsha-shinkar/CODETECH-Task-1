Data Persistence:

Use a storage solution (e.g., local storage, cloud database) to save tasks, ensuring data is not lost between sessions.
Scalability and Extendibility:

Implement a modular architecture that allows for future feature additions, such as:
Task reminders.
Integration with calendars.
Collaboration and sharing of task lists.
Performance Optimization:

Ensure the app runs smoothly with minimal loading times.
